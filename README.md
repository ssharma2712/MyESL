# Evolutionary Sparse Learning with MyESL #

## Introduction ##
MyESL is a set of programs written in C++ and Python designed to build an evolutionary sparse learning model for a phylogenetic hypothesis or binary classes of species with or without a phenotype. MyESL uses sparse group lasso regression to optimize weights for each position in the sequence alignments, quantifying the strength of association between a position and the hypothesis/class used in the analysis. MyESL also performs pre-possing of input data and processes ESL model outputs for further biological discoveries. MyESL is currently available as a standalone software `(MyESL.exe)` compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems. Moreover, it offers the option of installation via a Python environment to conduct ESL analysis. 

## Implementation of MyESL ## 
We discuss every required and optional argument for ESL analysis of an example dataset using MyESL software (MyESL.exe). Next, we will discuss installing MyESL in the Python environment.  

### Download ###
You can download `MyESL` from the GitHub repository or use the command 

	git clone -b grid_search https://github.com/kumarlabgit/MyESL MyESL
	cd ESL

### Usage ###

One can perform ESL analysis using `MyESL.exe` after downloading and setting the current working directory to MyESL.  

<br />

```
MyESL.exe alignment_list.txt  --tree phylogenetic_tree.nwk

OR

MyESL.exe alignment_list.txt  --classes classes.txt
```
<br />


### Required arguments:

<br />

```

alignment_list.txt                       : A text file contains a list of paths for all sequence alignments. For example,
                                           angiosperm_alns/7276_C12.fasta
                                           angiosperm_alns/5111_C12.fasta
                                           angiosperm_alns/5507_C12.fasta

--tree <phylogenetic_tree.nwk>           : A phylogenetic tree in newick format with a node ID to construct a hypothesis for the clade of interest.
                                           The hypothesis can also be specified with a separate file using the --classes parameter.
                                           It is highly recommended that the number of species in the clade be equal to or less than those outside of the clade.
                                           It is also recommended to use the smart sampling option (â€”-class_bal) when the number of species inside the clade is less or greater than the number outside the clade.
OR

--classes <classes.txt>                  : Requires a text file containing a user-defined hypothesis. It has two columns, which are tab-separated. The first column contains species names, and the second column contains the response 
                                          value for the species (+1/-1). A member species in the clade or with a specific phenotype receives +1 and -1 otherwise. This hypothesis is unconstrained by the tree structure. It is highly 
                                          recommended that the number of species with the response +1 equal the number of species with -1. 

```
<br />	

### Optional arguments:

Users can also specify other options in MyESL for processing the input data, building ESL models, and post-processing the ESL models. 

#### Pre-processing input data:

<br />

```
--clade_list <string1, string2,...> : Users can test multiple phylogenetic hypotheses when the input phylogenetic tree contains multiple clade IDs. This option must be used with "--tree" option.

--gen_clade_list <int, int>         : Users can generate multiple hypotheses when the input phylogeny contains no clade ID. The size of the clade is determined by the input integers defining the upper and lower limits
                                      of clade size, respectively.
   
--class_bal <string>                : MyESL performs class balancing, a common practice in supervised machine learning. Class balancing helps balance the number of species inside and outside the focal clade of interest.
                                      Class balancing in MyESL is performed by phylogenetic aware sampling <phylo> when the "--tree" option provides the phylogenetic hypothesis. MyESL also makes a balance between classes 
                                      by using inverse weights using the option <weight>. Upsampling and downsampling between classes can also be performed in MyESL using <up> and <down> options. 

--data_type <string>                : <nucleotide> informs MyESL to treat A, T, C, G, and U as valid characters without case sensitivity, and all other characters will be treated as missing data.
                                      <protein> option treats all unambiguous IUPAC amino acid letters (case insensitive) as valid characters.
                                      <molecular> option provides a way to use both nucleotide and acid letters as valid characters.
                                      <universal> option is used as default, which allows the analysis of presence/absence (0/1) data.

--bit_ct <int>                      : One can drop all bit-columns in which the bit 1 appears fewer than a certain number of times.

```
<br />	

#### ESL model building:

<br />

```
--lambda1 <float>                    : The site sparsity parameter that ranges from 0 to 1. When not specified, the default is 0.1. It is required to build a single-clade model.

--lambda2 <float>                    : The gene sparsity parameter ranges from 0 to 1, and the default is 0.1 when not specified. It is required to build a single-clade model.

--lamda1_grid <min, max, step>       : This option allows users to set the range for the site sparsity parameter. The site sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, and step_size, which range from 0 to 1.
                                       For example, --lamda1_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda2_range.  

--lamda2_grid <min, max, step>       : This option allows users to set the range for the group sparsity parameter. The group sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, and step_size, which range from 0 to 1.
                                       For example, --lamda2_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda1_range. 

--min_groups <int>                   : This option allows users to set the minimum number of genes included in the multi-gene ESL models and helps early stopping in the grid search over the sparsity parameter space.
                                       It takes a value greater than zero (0) and builds models containing more or equal numbers of groups in the model.

--group_wt <filename.txt>            : MyESL uses the square root of the number of bit columns for groups as group weights by default. Users can provide group weights via a text file (<filename.txt>), a tab-separated two-column file.
                                       The first column contains group names, and the second contains corresponding group weights.

--kfold <int>                        : This directive allows users to build multiple ESL models using k-fold cross-validation. For example, if k-fold is set to 5, 80% of rows are used in model training, and 20% of rows are withheld for validation.

--no_group_penalty                   : This directive allows users to perform LASSO regression without group penalty. The LASSO regression without group penalty is also performed when a single FastA file is provided as input. 

```
<br />	

#### Processing ESL-model outputs:

<br />

```
--output <string>                   : The name of the output directory where all results from MyESL analysis will be stored. The program creates an output directory automatically if it is not specified.

--stats_out <BPGHS>                 : MyESL processes the ESL model and outputs, Bit Sparsity Scores (<B>), Position Sparsity Scores (<P>), Gene Sparsity Scores (<G>), Hypothesis Sparsity Scores (<H>), and
                                      Species Sparsity Scores and Prediction Probability (<S>). Users can output multiple files using multiple inputs like <BPS>. Details of these scores can be found in reference #1.  
```
<br />	

### MyESL output files

MyESL produces multiple output files based on different user analysis directives. 

#### Output files from a single ESL model

<br />

```
ESL_model_{clade_ID}.txt   : A tab-separated text file containing allele at each position in a group and non-zero beta values estimated from sparse group lasso analysis. 

BSS_{clade_ID}.txt         : A tab-separated text file containing allele at each position in a group and non-zero bit sparsity score.
